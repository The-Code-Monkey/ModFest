Modfest 1.16 mod by AwwShoot and ExoticCollector.

To-Do-----

Ideas-----
concrete info:
Sci-fi themed biome based around a meteor's impact.

Needed info:
Color schemes
Mechanical focus
theme in more detail
lore(?)

Concepts:

What impact would the mod have on gameplay?
 - is it just biome generation?
 - will other mechanics be introduced?
 - can other meteors fall?

What do these meteor biomes have to offer?
 - What do the meteor(s) bring to Earth?
    - Do they contain alien metals/materials?
    - Was alien life introduced to the world?
      - How intelligent/sentient is it?
      - Is any of it hostile?
    - Can alien technology be found?
      - Is it found in good condition?
      - Can it be repurposed?

Does each biome have it's own meteor(s)?
 - Are the meteors large or small?
    - If large, how large? Do they generate as unique structures?
    - If small, do they even generate? Will the players see their aftermath more than the actual meteors?
 - If so, are there different variations of the biome because of this?
    - Do the meteors have major differences from biome to biome?

Does the mod only involve the effects of one meteor?
 - How do the biomes form then?
 - Does this meteor generate?
